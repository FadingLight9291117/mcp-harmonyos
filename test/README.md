# Test Configuration

This directory contains test files and configurations for local testing.

## Manual Testing

To test the MCP server manually:

1. Start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. The server will listen on stdio and wait for MCP protocol messages.

3. Test with a real AI assistant by configuring OpenCode or Claude Desktop.

## Quick Functionality Check

You can verify the tools are registered by checking the build output and ensuring the server starts without errors.
